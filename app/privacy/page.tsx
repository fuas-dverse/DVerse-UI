<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Special and/or sensitive personal data that we process.</h1>
<p>Our website and/or service does not intend to collect data about website visitors who are younger than 16 years old.
     Unless they have permission from parents or guardians. However, we cannot verify that a visitor is over the age of 16.
     We encourage parents to be involved in their children's online activities in order to prevent the collection of information about 
     children without parental consent. If you are convinced that we have collected personal data about a minor without such consent, 
     please contact us at info@dverse.com and we will delete this information.
     </p>

<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">For what purpose and on what basis do we process personal data?</h1>
<p>DVerse processes your personal data for the following purposes:</p>
<ul className="list-disc">
    <li>To be able to call or e-mail you if this is necessary to be able to perform our services</li>
    <li>Inform you about changes to our services and products</li>
    <li>Enable you to create an account</li>
    <li>DVerse also processes personal data if we are legally obliged to do so, such as data that we need for our tax return or the production of information if the court deems it necessary.</li>
</ul>



<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Automated decision-making</h1>
<p>DVerse takes responsibility on the basis of automated processing and makes decisions about matters that may have (significant) consequences for individuals. <br />
    These are decisions that are made by computer programs or systems, without a human being (e.g., an employee of DVerse) being involved.
     DVerse uses the following computer programs or systems:</p>
<ul className="list-disc">
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>
    NextJS
        
    </li>
    <ul className="list-disc ml-5">
        <li>Middleware with security http-headers.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
</ul>

<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">How long we keep personal data.</h1>
<p>DVerse does not store your personal data any longer than is strictly necessary to achieve the purposes for which your data is collected.
    We use the following retention periods for the following (categories of) personal data:
</p>

<p>
Voluntary account cancellation: your account will remain with your standard data for a maximum of 2 weeks so that legal process has time to use it. 
This is also possible if you have changed your mind and want the account back.
 After these 2 weeks, your personal data will be changed to substitute data.
</p>

<p>
Legal account termination: As soon as the legal termination has been obtained, 
your account will be deleted as soon as possible and changed by substitute data. 
You cannot get this account back because DVerse does not know your account details itself.
</p>

<p>Cancelling a child's account: this is similar to the legal account cancellation,
     but DVerse will first provide a different password for it and within a week the personal details will be changed to substitutes so 
     that DVerse can use the questions asked for further processing to know what is being asked for our platform.
</p>

<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Sharing personal data with third parties</h1>

<p>DVerse does not sell your data to third parties and only provides it if this is necessary for the execution of our agreement with you or 
    to comply with a legal obligation. 
    We enter into a processing agreement with companies that process your data on our behalf to ensure the same level of 
    security and confidentiality of your data. DVerse remains responsible for this processing.

</p>

<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h1>
<p>we may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), 
    and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected,
     and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.
</p>

<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">What is GDPR?</h1>
<p>GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies and enhances the control
     the EU residents have, over their personal data.
</p>

<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">What is personal data?</h1>
<p>Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person's name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p>
<ul className="list-disc">
    <li>Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.
</li>
    <li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.
</li>
    <li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.
</li>
    <li>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data.
They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.
</li>
</ul>

<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Why is GDPR important?</h1> 
<p>GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At DVerse we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.
